# Homework 3

*This document is a work in progress...*

The goals of this third exercise include:

- configuring and using a popular opaque box web app testing tool called [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
- complete the example tests for your chosen language provided by Playwright.
- writing your own E2E Playwright test using the Playwright Test Generator.
- continuing to learn Markdown and `git` by checking your Homework2 and a README.md file into GitHub.

[Homework 1](homework-1.md) was mostly a step-by-step recipe with little original effort. [Homework 2](homework-2.md) was involved branch analysis, standard and parameterized unit testing, and achieving 100% code coverage. This final homework assignment will introduce you to end-to-end testing using Playwright, a popular framework for testing web-based applications. End-to-end testing (also called E2E) is a form of opaque box testing where you validate the operation of the surface controls of a system rather than the system's internal code and state. 

Please dedicate the time and effort to complete this homework. *Everything* you see here will appear in the semester project.

## Homework 1 and 2 are Prerequisite

Homework 3 assumes you completed and understood the material in Homework 1 and Homework 2 

If you have not completed [Homework 1](homework-1.md) and/or [Homework 2](homework-2.md), please complete those before starting Homework 3.

## I Need Help

Try Homework 1 and 2, then stop by my desk after any lecture for help. I almost always stay after to help students. You must attempt Homeworks 1 and 2 before requesting help. Remember that you have significant Internet resources to assist you. If you are having trouble with Homework 3, you can also expect me to review your completed [Homework 1](homework-1.md)  and [Homework 2](homework-2.md) efforts, so do not skip those.

If you want me to review your work after you check it in, you are welcome to email the URL to your GitHub homework repository.

### Section 5: Check-in Homework 3 to your GitHub Homework Repository

1. Create a README.md file in the root directory of Homework3.

2. Put the following Markdown in your `Homework3/README.md` file. 

   ```markdown
   # Homework 3
   
   1. Configured Playwright
   2. Verified Operation with a Sample E2E Test
      { SCREENSHOT OF YOUR Sample E2E TEST HERE }
      { SCREENSHOT OF YOUR JETBRAINS TEST RUNNER SHOWING SUCCESS OF Sample E2E TEST }
   3. Wrote an E2E Test using the Playwright Test Generator
      { SCREENSHOT OF YOUR Generated E2E Test HERE}
      { SCREENSHOT OF YOUR JETBRAINS TEST RUNNER SHOWING SUCCESS OF Generated E2E TEST }
   4. Executed Tests from Command Line / Terminal
      { SCREENSHOT OF TERMINAL SHOWING COMMANDS TO START TESTING, PLUS RESULTS}
   ```

3. Check-in your Homework3 folder to your local `git` homework repository.

4. Push your changes to your remote GitHub repository.

5. Visit the URL for your GitHub repository and navigate to the Homework2 folder. 

   - Does your README.md file look correct? Fix any formatting problems and check-in the corrections.
   - Can you see your images? 

   ***Always take a few moments to carefully review your checked-in work. You put a lot of effort into this. Make sure it is all there and looks great. Bad software engineers submit broken and incomplete code. It is very frustrating! Learn to do this properly, and your future teammates will enjoy working with you.***
