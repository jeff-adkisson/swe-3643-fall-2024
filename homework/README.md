# Homework 

*Not graded, but highly highly highly recommended you perform it.*

- [Homework 1](homework-1.md) 
  *Setting up your JetBrains environment, performing a unit test tutorial, and posting your work to your GitHub repository.*
- [Homework 2](homework-2.md) 
  *Performing branch analysis on an algorithm, writing standard and parameterized unit tests to reach 100% coverage, and posting your work to your GitHub repository.*
- [Homework 3](homework-3.md)
  *Performing end-to-end (E2E) opaque box testing using Playwright, and posting your work to your GitHub repository.*

**HOMEWORK IS NOT GRADED! WHY SHOULD I BOTHER?**

You must learn how to do the work. Therefore, the work is its own reward. If that is not enough motivation, remember that this work will prepare you for the project and *that is 50% of your grade*. If you do not do the homework, you will struggle to complete the project.

You must become proficient in these topics to be competitive in the industry. If you want to find work quickly after graduation, you must be technically proficient. Grades without the skills to back them up mean nothing in the real world. It is easy to graduate without performing a lot of hands-on work. I recommend avoiding that outcome.
